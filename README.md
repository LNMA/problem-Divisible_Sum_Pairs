# problem-Divisible_Sum_Pairs

Review:

You are given an array of (n) integers ar=[a[0],a[1],a[2]...a[n-1]] , and a positive integer (k). Find and print the number of 
(i,j) pairs where where i<j and ar[i]+ar[j] is divisible by (k).

For example ar=[1,2,3,4,5,6] ,k=5 . Our three pairs meeting the criteria are [1,4],[2,3],[4,6].
